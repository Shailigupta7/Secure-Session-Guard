# Secure-Session-Guard
It is a Command Line Tool with JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A utility designed for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) manipulation is available through the command line. This tool aids in 
secure authentication and session management. The server generates an encrypted "access Token" containing the "user Id" and "expires in" information using the 
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET. Subsequently, it sends this "access Token" to the client-side browser. The browser then stores the "access Token" locally and includes it in all 
future requests made to the server.
